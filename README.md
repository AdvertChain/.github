# AdvertChain

## Project Overview

This project offers a software solution that integrates blockchain technology into a commission-based advertising task system. Project owners can create tasks for the target audience they want to advertise to, and those who complete these tasks are rewarded with a specific commission.

## How it Works

This software is built on blockchain technology and facilitates the management of advertising tasks through smart contracts. Project owners can create and publish advertising tasks using predefined smart contracts. Users can view, accept, and complete these tasks, and they are rewarded upon completion.
